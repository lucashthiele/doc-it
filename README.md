# üöÄ DocIT

DocIT is a powerful tool designed to simplify the process of creating professional and comprehensive documentation for your GitHub repositories. With the help of an AI-powered agent, DocIT automates the process of analyzing your codebase and generating a detailed README file that highlights all essential information about your project.  

## ‚ú® Features  

- **Seamless GitHub Integration**: Connect your GitHub account and choose the repository to document.  
- **AI-Powered Analysis**: The AI agent examines your repository, extracting key details about your project.  
- **Detailed Documentation**: Automatically generate a README file with sections like:  
  - Project title and brief description  
  - Installation instructions  
  - Build and run commands  
  - Contribution guidelines  
  - Any additional information the AI deems relevant  
- **Customizable Output**: Edit the generated documentation to suit your needs before automagically adding it to your repository.
